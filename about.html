<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Devansh Desai and if I were to introduce myself in one word all I would say is CONSISTENCE.</p>

<p>I am 19 years old, 5 Feet 9 inches tall, weighing at 61 kgs with a less than 12% body fat. One would find me to be enthousiastic, 
  determined, hardworking, skilled, focused, talented and accurate fit for an entrepreneur. Ever since I have understood what wealth/money is 
  I have given up every distraction and have only focused upon my future and my desire to be a bilionaire, a tech billionaire, to be particular, like 
  my one true inspiration Mark Zuckerberg. I desire to build an company that would not only provide jobs to millions but also would be for 
  the betterment of the entire world. I desire to be the founder and CEO of this company which would have a valuation of a trillion dollar which 
  I strongly believe that I am more than just capable enough to do. In order to achieve my desires I have taken up several changes in my life, I read only 
  educational books, surf the internet only for such topics and follow the sayings of the ones who have done it before me. I have developed a mindset 
  of a billionaire already, in my opinion, but I still have some areas to cover. I am currently working on an app that would possibly be the next 
  facebook, an app that would change the world we live in. I believe this would be my first step towards the billinaire status.</p>

<p>The first time I saw 'the social network', I could not believe a 23 years old Mark Zuckerberg could run a massive massive company and be good at it.
  At was at this moment I decided that if I want to be a successful man in his 20s I have to follow the steps of Mark Zuckerberg. 
  I do not care what people think of me, I do not care if I loose my friends to parties and clubbing and reckless nights, I will be focused and 
  determined to my path. I am destined to be a billionaire and I know I will have to work hard for it.</p>
